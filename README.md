# React-Portfolio
UConn Bootcamp Chapter 20 React Challenge


## Description
In this chapter 20 challenge I took my knowledge of React and used it to create an interactive React Portfolio.  I now have a valuable asset to use in my journey towards becoming a web developer as I can use this RReact Portfolio as a representation of my work in the future.


## Process
* The first thing I did after creating the repository was adding in base files that could hold my old portfolio's HTML and CSS. This created a functional page, but not one with any React functionality.

* The next step was to fix all of the styling issues that occurred when converting over my old portfolio's information.  For one reason or another, certain styles got corrupted and needed debugging.  This was done over various commits and pushes.

* Finally, I added in some useState hooks for my portfolio.  For example, the onClick functions for the arrows used to display information in About, Contact, and Resume use this useState hook.

## Conclusion
Overall, this was a great first React project.  I enjoyed using the 'useState' hooks and the overall use of React in this project was very interesting to me as previously I had a very stagnant, lifeless portfolio.  I really enjoyed this introduction to React.
